# /etc/motd

The `/etc/motd` file, or "Message of the Day," is a text file found in Unix-like operating systems. It serves as a welcome message displayed to users upon logging in.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of the `/etc/motd` file is to provide important information, announcements, or a friendly greeting to users when they access the system. System administrators can use this file to communicate messages, updates, or any relevant information to users.

## Customization
Administrators can edit the contents of `/etc/motd` to customize the message according to their needs. This may include system-related announcements, maintenance schedules, or any other information that users should be aware of.

## Automatic Display
The contents of `/etc/motd` are typically displayed automatically by the system during the login process. Users will see the message after entering their credentials but before gaining access to the command prompt or graphical interface.

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how the `/etc/motd` file might be used:
